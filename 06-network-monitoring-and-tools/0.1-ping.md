# Ping

Ping is a network troubleshooting tool used to **check connectivity**
between two devices using **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**.

---

## How Ping Works
1. The source device sends an **ICMP Echo Request** packet.
2. The destination device receives the request.
3. The destination replies with an **ICMP Echo Reply** packet.
4. The source measures the **round-trip time (RTT)**.
5. Results show packet loss and latency.

---

## What Info It Finds
- Host availability
- Network latency (response time)
- Packet loss percentage

open a kali terminal and pind for a domain name or domain IP of perticular domain 

## Basic Syntax / Command
ping google.com
pind 8.8.8.8

## PRACTICAL
# Task 1:
Ping works on both Kali linux and Windows. For this lab, we will be demonstrating ping on Kali Linux VM machine. To begin, open a terminal window. Then, type the following:

ping google.com

![ping output]()

The ping command will continue to send ICMP packages to the destinated IP address until it receives an interruption. As you will see, a number of lines of information will appear on our screen. This shows the packets being sent from our machine to google.com, as well as the response being received. We sent out 7 packets and received 7 packets back, indicating that google.com is up and responding to requests.

# Task 2:
ping will continue to send packages until it receives an interrupt signal. To specify the number of echo request packages to be sent after pings exit, use the -c option followed by the number of packages:

ping -c 5 cisco.com

![ping output]()

# Task 3:
When you run the ping command, it will use either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on your machine’s DNS settings. To force ping to use IPv4, pass the -4 option, or use its alias: ping4. To force ping to use IPv6, pass the -6 option, or use its alias: ping6;

ping -4 localhost

ping -6 localhost

To send 5 packets which “will not fragment the flag (IPv4 only)” pass “-M dont” option with the following command:

ping -M dont localhost -4 -c 5

![ping output]()
