# Ping

Ping is a network troubleshooting tool used to **check connectivity**
between two devices using **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**.

---

## How Ping Works
1. The source device sends an **ICMP Echo Request** packet.
2. The destination device receives the request.
3. The destination replies with an **ICMP Echo Reply** packet.
4. The source measures the **round-trip time (RTT)**.
5. Results show packet loss and latency.

## What Info It Finds
- Host availability
- Network latency (response time)
- Packet loss percentage
