# Netstat

Netstat (Network Statistics) is a command-line tool used to display active network connections, listening ports, routing tables, and network interface statistics. It is very useful for monitoring network activity and detecting suspicious connections.

---

## What Information Netstat Finds
- Active TCP and UDP connections
- Listening ports and services
- Local and foreign IP addresses
- Network routing table
- Process IDs (PID) using network ports

---

## How Netstat Works
Netstat reads kernel network information and displays real-time network communication details. It helps administrators and security analysts understand which services are communicating over the network.

## Basic Syntax (Linux / Kali)
netstat

# Commonly Used Commands

| Command         | Description                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `netstat -a`    | Show all connections              |
| `netstat -tuln` | Show listening TCP/UDP ports      |
| `netstat -r`    | Display routing table             |
| `netstat -p`    | Show process using the connection |
| `netstat -i`    | Network interface statistics      |

## PRACTICAL:

# Task 1:
We will begin by viewing the help information screen by executing the following command:

netstat -h

We will then view all active connections by typing the following:

netstat

# Task 2:
We can use netstat to display both local and foreign addresses in numeric IP form using the “-n” parameter.

netstat -n

If we want to view only TCP connections, we need to add the “-t” parameter.

netstat -t

Similary, if we want to view only UDP connections, we need to add the “-u” parameter.

netstat -u

We can combine and operate multiple parameters in a single command as follows;
