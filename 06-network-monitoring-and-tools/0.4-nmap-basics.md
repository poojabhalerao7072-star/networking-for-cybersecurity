# Nmap 

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is an open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It helps identify live hosts, open ports, running services, versions, and operating systems on a target network.

Nmap is widely used by:
- Penetration testers
- SOC analysts
- Network administrators
- Cybersecurity students

> ⚠️ **Ethical Use Only:** Always scan systems you own or have permission to test.

---

## Why Nmap is Important in Cybersecurity
- Identify exposed services and attack surface
- Detect misconfigurations
- Support vulnerability assessment
- Used in reconnaissance (first phase of pentesting)

## Basic Nmap Syntax

nmap [options] <target>

## Commonly Used Nmap Scans

| Scan Type | Command | Purpose | Requires Root |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Ping Scan (Host Discovery) | `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24` | Identifies live hosts in a network |  No |
| TCP Connect Scan | `nmap -sT example.com` | Performs full TCP handshake to detect open ports |  No |
| SYN Scan (Stealth Scan) | `sudo nmap -sS example.com` | Half-open scan, faster and stealthier |  Yes |
| UDP Scan | `sudo nmap -sU example.com` | Scans UDP services (DNS, SNMP, DHCP) |  Yes |
| Service Version Scan | `nmap -sV example.com` | Detects service name and version |  No |
| OS Detection | `sudo nmap -O example.com` | Identifies operating system of target |  Yes |
| Aggressive Scan | `sudo nmap -A example.com` | OS, version, scripts & traceroute |  Yes |
| Default Script Scan | `nmap -sC example.com` | Runs default NSE scripts |  No |
| Vulnerability Scan | `nmap --script vuln example.com` | Detects known vulnerabilities |  No |

## practical:

site: scanme.nmap.org

Note: This site has been developed by Nmap for the purpose of scanning. Never scan any site, system, or network without prior permission from the owner.

## Task 1:
Nmap comes pre-installed in Kali Linux. Just open a terminal, type 'nmap scanme.nmap.org'. This will initiate a scan of the target and will attempt to determine which ports are open and what services are open on these ports.

 there are 4 ports open, and there are different services running on each port. The scan we just performed, however, is a very basic scan and will only scan the top 1000 ports for basic information.


## Task 2:
In this step, we will be scanning the same target, scanme.nmap.org, but with a more advanced scan.to determine the operating system of the webserver running the target site. We will run the following scan to determine this information:

Oops! You must be root before doing this type of scan. Type “sudo” and  re-enter nmap command with desired parameters. The line in the terminal will be like the following:

sudo nmap -v -sT -sV -O scanme.nmap.org

When asked for the password, type “kali” without inverted commas.
