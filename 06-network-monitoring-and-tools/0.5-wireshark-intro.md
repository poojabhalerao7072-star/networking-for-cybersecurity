# Wireshark 

**Wireshark** is an open-source **network packet analyzer** used to capture and inspect network traffic in real time. It allows users to see what is happening on a network at a very detailed level.

Wireshark is widely used by:
- SOC Analysts
- Network Engineers
- Penetration Testers
- Cybersecurity Students

---

## Why Wireshark is Important in Cybersecurity
- Detect suspicious or malicious traffic
- Analyze network attacks
- Troubleshoot network issues
- Understand protocol behavior
- Used heavily in **SOC monitoring**

---

## How Wireshark Works
Wireshark works by:
1. Capturing packets from a network interface
2. Decoding protocols (Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP, etc.)
3. Displaying packet details in a readable format

---

## Wireshark Interface Overview

### 1. Packet List Pane
- Displays captured packets
- Shows source, destination, protocol, and info

### 2. Packet Details Pane
- Shows protocol layers
- Ethernet → IP → TCP/UDP → Application

### 3. Packet Bytes Pane
- Raw packet data in hexadecimal and ASCII

---

## Starting a Packet Capture

### Steps:
1. Open Wireshark
2. Select a network interface (Wi-Fi / Ethernet)
3. Click **Start Capture**
4. Generate traffic (ping, browse website)
5. Stop capture

---

## Common Protocols Seen in Wireshark
- **TCP** – Reliable communication
- **UDP** – Fast, connectionless communication
- **HTTP / HTTPS** – Web traffic
- **DNS** – Domain name resolution
- **ARP** – IP to MAC mapping
- **ICMP** – Ping & error messages

---

## Basic Wireshark Use Cases

### Network Troubleshooting
- Packet loss detection
- Latency analysis
- Connection failures

### Security Analysis
- Detect port scanning
- Identify malware communication
- Analyze suspicious IP traffic

## Practical:

# Task 1
After executing the 'wireshark' command on a kali terminal, the Wireshark application will open. You should see the main Wireshark interface that displays available network interfaces.

The output will look similar to this:

![wireshark imd]()

# task 2

To apply a filter, type it in the filter bar at the top of the window. For example, to show only TCP traffic, enter:  TCP
Press Enter or click the blue arrow button to apply the filter.

The result will show only TCP packets:

# task 3

Learning to apply Advanced Wireshark Filtering Techniques

- **Logical operators**
 
  ip.src == 192.168.1.10 and tcp
  tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443
  not arp
  
IP address filtering:

ip.addr == 10.0.0.5
ip.src == 192.168.1.10
ip.dst == 8.8.8.8

Port filtering:

tcp.port == 22
udp.port == 53

Protocol filtering:
tcp
udp
dns
http

Packet size filtering:

frame.len > 1000

TCP flags (scan detection):

tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0

tcp.flags.fin == 1

Time-based filtering:

frame.time_relative < 5

Follow stream:

Right click → Follow → TCP Stream
