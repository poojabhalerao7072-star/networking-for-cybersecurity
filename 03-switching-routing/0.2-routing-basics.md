# Routing Basics

Routing is the process of **forwarding packets between different networks** using **IP addresses**.  
Routers operate at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.

---

## What is Routing?
Routing determines the **best path** for data to travel from a source network to a destination network.

Works at **OSI Layer 3**  
Uses **IP addresses**  
Performed by **routers**

---

## What is a Router?
A **router** is a network device that connects multiple networks and forwards packets based on IP addresses.

Example:
- Home router connecting LAN to the Internet
- Enterprise router connecting multiple subnets

---

## How Routing Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Packet arrives at the router
2. Router reads the **destination IP address**
3. Checks the **routing table**
4. Selects the best path
5. Forwards the packet to the next hop

---

## Routing Table
A routing table contains:
- Destination network
- Subnet mask
- Next hop
- Interface

Example:
Destination     Next Hop
192.168.1.0     192.168.1.1
0.0.0.0         ISP Gateway

## Types of Routing

### 1️⃣ Static Routing
- Manually configured
- Simple but not scalable

### 2️⃣ Dynamic Routing
- Automatically updated
- Uses routing protocols

Examples:
- RIP
- OSPF
- BGP

---

## Default Route
- Used when no specific route matches
- Represented as: 0.0.0.0/0

--
## Common Routing-Related Attacks
- IP spoofing
- Route hijacking
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks

---

## Security Best Practices
- Use access control lists (ACLs)
- Secure routing protocols
- Disable unused routes
- Monitor routing changes

## Routing vs Switching
| Feature | Switching | Routing |
|------|---------|--------|
| OSI Layer | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
| Address Used | MAC | IP |
| Scope | Same network | Different networks |

---
## Cybersecurity Importance
Routing is critical for:
- Network segmentation
- Traffic control
- Firewall rule enforcement
- Preventing unauthorized access
