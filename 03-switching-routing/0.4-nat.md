# NAT (Network Address Translation)

## What is NAT?
NAT (Network Address Translation) is a networking technique used to translate
**private IP addresses** into **public IP addresses** and vice versa.

It allows multiple devices in a private network to access the internet using
a **single public IP address**.

---

## Why NAT is Needed
- IPv4 address shortage
- Hides internal IP addresses (basic security)
- Allows private networks to access the internet
- Reduces cost of public IP allocation

---

## How NAT Works (Simple Flow)
1. Device sends request using private IP
2. Router replaces private IP with public IP
3. Request goes to the internet
4. Response comes back to router
5. Router forwards it to correct internal device

## Types of NAT

### 1. Static NAT
- One private IP ↔ One public IP
- Fixed mapping
- Used for servers

Example: 192.168.1.10 ↔ 203.0.113.10

---

### 2. Dynamic NAT
- Private IP mapped to public IP from a pool
- Mapping changes dynamically
- Less commonly used

---

### 3. PAT (Port Address Translation) / NAT Overload
- Multiple private IPs use **one public IP**
- Differentiated using **port numbers**
- Most common NAT type

Example: 192.168.1.10:50432 → 203.0.113.5:30001
         192.168.1.11:50433 → 203.0.113.5:30002

## NAT Table
A router maintains a NAT table to track:
- Private IP
- Private Port
- Public IP
- Public Port

---

## NAT and OSI Model
- Operates at **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
- PAT also involves **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**

---

## NAT in Cybersecurity

### Advantages
- Hides internal network structure
- Reduces direct exposure to internet

### Limitations
- Not a replacement for firewall
- Can break some protocols (FTP, VoIP)
- Makes end-to-end tracing difficult

## NAT vs Firewall

| NAT | Firewall |
|----|---------|
| Translates IP addresses | Filters traffic |
| Not security-focused | Security-focused |
| Hides internal IPs | Blocks/permits packets |

## Real-Life Example
Home Wi-Fi router:
- Devices use private IPs (192.168.x.x)
- Router uses one public IP from ISP
- NAT enables internet access
