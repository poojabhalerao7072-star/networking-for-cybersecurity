# Switching Basics

Switching is a **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** process that forwards data frames within a local network (LAN) using **MAC addresses**.

## What is a Switch?
A **network switch** connects multiple devices in a LAN and forwards data only to the intended destination device.

 Works at **OSI Layer 2**  
 Uses **MAC addresses**  
 Smarter than a hub

## How Switching Works
1. A frame arrives at the switch
2. Switch reads the **source MAC address**
3. Stores it in the **MAC address table**
4. Checks destination MAC:
   - If known → forwards to correct port
   - If unknown → floods to all ports

## MAC Address Table (CAM Table)
- Stores **MAC address ↔ Port number**
- Built dynamically
- Helps reduce unnecessary traffic

Example: MAC Address    Port
         AA:BB:CC:11:22  1
         DD:EE:FF:33:44  3


## Types of Switching
### 1️⃣ Unicast
- One sender → one receiver

### 2️⃣ Broadcast
- One sender → all devices
- Example: ARP request

### 3️⃣ Multicast
- One sender → selected group


## Switch vs Hub
| Feature | Hub | Switch |
|------|----|----|
| OSI Layer | Layer 1 | Layer 2 |
| Traffic | Broadcast | Intelligent forwarding |
| Security | Low | Higher |
| Performance | Slow | Fast |

## VLAN (Virtual LAN)
- Logically divides a switch into multiple networks
- Improves **security** and **performance**

Example:
- VLAN 10 → HR
- VLAN 20 → IT

## Cybersecurity Importance
- Prevents unnecessary packet exposure
- VLANs reduce attack surface
- Helps defend against:
  - Packet sniffing
  - ARP spoofing
  - Network flooding
