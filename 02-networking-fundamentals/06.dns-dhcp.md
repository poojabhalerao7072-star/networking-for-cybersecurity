# DNS and DHCP

DNS and DHCP are core network services that make the internet usable and manageable.  
DNS resolves names to IP addresses, while DHCP automatically assigns IP configurations.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

### What is DNS?
DNS converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

**Example:**www.google.com → 142.250.190.14

Without DNS, users would need to remember IP addresses.


### DNS Components
- **Domain Name** – Human-friendly name (example.com)
- **IP Address** – Numeric identifier
- **DNS Server** – Resolves domain names
- **DNS Records** – Store mapping information


### Common DNS Record Types

| Record | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| A | Maps domain to IPv4 address |
| AAAA | Maps domain to IPv6 address |
| CNAME | Alias for another domain |
| MX | Mail server information |
| NS | Authoritative name server |
| TXT | Verification and security info |


### How DNS Works (Step-by-Step)
1. User enters a website name
2. Request is sent to a DNS resolver
3. Resolver queries DNS servers
4. IP address is returned
5. Browser connects to the server

### DNS Port
- **Port 53**
- Uses **UDP** (queries)
- Uses **TCP** (zone transfers)


### DNS Security Risks
- DNS spoofing / poisoning
- DNS amplification attacks
- Malicious domain redirection


### DNS in Cybersecurity
- Used in phishing attacks
- Malware communicates via DNS
- DNS logs help in threat detection


## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

### What is DHCP?
DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and network settings to devices.

### Information Assigned by DHCP
- IP Address
- Subnet Mask
- Default Gateway
- DNS Server

### DHCP Process (DORA)
1. **Discover** – Client searches for DHCP server
2. **Offer** – Server offers IP address
3. **Request** – Client requests offered IP
4. **Acknowledge** – Server confirms assignment
   

### DHCP Port Numbers
- **UDP 67** – Server
- **UDP 68** – Client
  

### Advantages of DHCP
- Automatic IP configuration
- Reduces human errors
- Easy network management


### DHCP Security Risks
- Rogue DHCP servers
- DHCP starvation attacks
- Unauthorized IP assignment


### DHCP in Cybersecurity
- Attackers can redirect traffic
- Used in network-based attacks
- DHCP monitoring improves security

## DNS vs DHCP

| Feature | DNS | DHCP |
|------|-----|------|
| Purpose | Name resolution | IP assignment |
| Port | 53 | 67 / 68 |
| Protocol | UDP / TCP | UDP |
| Cyber Risk | Spoofing | Rogue servers |
