# Subnetting (IP Subdivision)

## What is Subnetting?
Subnetting is the process of **dividing a large IP network into smaller logical networks** called **subnets**.
It helps in:
- Efficient IP address usage
- Better network management
- Improved security

## Why Subnetting is Needed
- To reduce network congestion
- To isolate different departments/networks
- To limit broadcast traffic
- To improve security by segmentation

## Basic Terms in Subnetting

### 1. Network Address
- Identifies the network
- First IP address in a subnet
- Example: `192.168.1.0`

### 2. Broadcast Address
- Used to send data to all devices in a subnet
- Last IP address in a subnet
- Example: `192.168.1.255`

### 3. Usable IP Addresses
- IPs that can be assigned to devices
- Total IPs − Network address − Broadcast address

## Subnet Mask
A subnet mask defines **which part of the IP address is network and which part is host**.
Example:
- IP Address: 192.168.1.10
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Binary form: 255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

### What is CIDR?
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method of **representing IP addresses using a prefix length** instead of traditional class-based subnetting.

CIDR shows **how many bits are used for the network portion** of an IP address.

### CIDR Notation Format
IP_address / prefix_length


Example: 192.168.1.0/24


- 192.168.1.0 → Network address  
- /24 → 24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts

### Why CIDR is Used
- Removes limitations of Class A, B, C
- Allows flexible subnet sizes
- Reduces IP address wastage
- Improves routing efficiency

### CIDR vs Classful Addressing

| Feature | Classful | CIDR |
|------|--------|------|
| Fixed sizes | Yes | No |
| Efficient IP usage | ❌ | ✅ |
| Uses / notation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modern networks | ❌ | ✅ |


### CIDR Prefix and Subnet Mask

| CIDR | Subnet Mask |
|----|-------------|
| /8 | 255.0.0.0 |
| /16 | 255.255.0.0 |
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 |
| /30 | 255.255.255.252 |

### CIDR and Number of Hosts
Formula:
Total IPs = 2^(32 − prefix)
Usable IPs = Total IPs − 2

Example:/26 → 2^(32−26) = 64 IPs
Usable = 62
