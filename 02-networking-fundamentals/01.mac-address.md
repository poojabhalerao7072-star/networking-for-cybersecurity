# MAC Address

## What is a MAC Address?
A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a **unique physical address** assigned to a network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.
It is used to identify devices **within a local network (LAN)**.

## MAC Address Format

- 48-bit address
- Written in hexadecimal
- Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E


## Types of MAC Addresses

### 1. Unicast
- Identifies a single device

### 2. Broadcast
- Sends data to all devices
- Example:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF


### 3. Multicast
- Sends data to a group of devices

## Where MAC Address is Used
- Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2)
- Switching
- ARP protocol

## Cybersecurity Importance
- Used in ARP poisoning attacks
- MAC spoofing hides attacker identity
- MAC filtering provides basic security
