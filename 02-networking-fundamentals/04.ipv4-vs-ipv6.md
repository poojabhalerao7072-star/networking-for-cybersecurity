# IPv4 vs IPv6

## What is an IP Address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a **unique identifier** assigned to a device on a network to enable communication.

## IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)

### Overview
- Uses **32-bit** addressing
- Written in **decimal format**
- Limited number of addresses
### Example : 192.168.1.1

## IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)
### Overview
- Uses **128-bit** addressing
- Written in **hexadecimal format**
- Designed to replace IPv4

### Example : 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

### Features
- Extremely large address space
- No need for NAT
- Built-in security support
- Better performance and routing efficiency

## Key Differences Between IPv4 and IPv6

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|------|------|------|
| Address size | 32-bit | 128-bit |
| Format | Decimal | Hexadecimal |
| Address space | Limited | Huge |
| NAT required | Yes | No |
| Header size | Variable | Fixed |
| Security | Optional (IPSec) | Built-in |
| Broadcast | Supported | ❌ Not supported |
| Multicast | Limited | Advanced |

## IPv4 vs IPv6 in Cybersecurity
### IPv4 Security Issues
- IP spoofing
- NAT complexity
- Limited address tracking

### IPv6 Security Advantages
- IPSec support
- End-to-end connectivity
- Better device identification

⚠️ Misconfigured IPv6 can still be exploited.
