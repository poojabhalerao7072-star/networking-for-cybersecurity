# Ports and Protocols

Ports are logical endpoints that allow multiple network services to run on a single system.  
Each port is associated with a specific service or protocol.

## Common Ports and Their Services

| Port Number | Service | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 20 | FTP (Data) | FTP data transfer |
| 21 | FTP (Control) | FTP command control |
| 22 | SSH | Secure remote login |
| 23 | Telnet | Insecure remote access |
| 25 | SMTP | Email sending |
| 53 | DNS | Domain name resolution |
| 80 | HTTP | Web traffic (unencrypted) |
| 137–139 | NetBIOS | Windows file sharing |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure web traffic |
| 445 | SMB | Windows file sharing |
| 1433 | MSSQL | Microsoft SQL database |
| 3306 | MySQL | MySQL database |
| 3389 | RDP | Remote Desktop Protocol |
| 5800 | VNC (Web) | VNC over HTTP |
| 5900 | VNC | Virtual Network Computing |

## Detail Notes Common Ports

### FTP – Ports 20 & 21
- Used for file transfer between systems
- Port 21 handles commands
- Port 20 handles data transfer
- Sends data in plain text
**Security Risk:** Vulnerable to sniffing attacks

---

### SSH – Port 22
- Secure remote access protocol
- Encrypts all communication
- Used for server administration
**Security Risk:** Brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used

---

### Telnet – Port 23
- Remote access protocol
- No encryption
**Security Risk:** Highly insecure and obsolete

---

### SMTP – Port 25
- Used to send emails between mail servers
**Security Risk:** Can be abused for spam attacks

---

### DNS – Port 53
- Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- Uses UDP and TCP
**Security Risk:** DNS poisoning and amplification attacks

---

### HTTP – Port 80
- Transfers web data without encryption
**Security Risk:** Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks

---

### HTTPS – Port 443
- Secure version of HTTP
- Uses SSL/TLS encryption
**Security Benefit:** Protects data confidentiality and integrity

---

### NetBIOS – Ports 137–139
- Used for Windows network services
**Security Risk:** Information leakage if exposed

---

### SMB – Port 445
- File sharing protocol used in Windows
**Security Risk:** Exploited in attacks like EternalBlue

---

### MSSQL – Port 1433
- Microsoft SQL Server database port
**Security Risk:** Exposed databases can lead to data theft

---

### MySQL – Port 3306
- Database communication port
**Security Risk:** Should not be publicly accessible

---

### RDP – Port 3389
- Remote desktop access for Windows systems
**Security Risk:** Common target for ransomware and brute-force attacks

---

### VNC – Ports 5800 & 5900
- Remote graphical desktop access
- 5800: Web access
- 5900: Client access
**Security Risk:** Weak authentication risks

## Cybersecurity Importance
- Open ports increase attack surface
- Port scanning is the first step in penetration testing
- Firewalls control traffic based on ports
- Secure protocols should replace insecure ones
