# IDS & IPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems)

IDS and IPS are **security technologies used to detect and stop
malicious network activities**.

They monitor network traffic for suspicious behavior and known attacks.

## IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

### What is IDS?
An **IDS** monitors network traffic and **alerts** when it detects
suspicious or malicious activity.

➡️ IDS does **NOT block** traffic  
➡️ IDS only **detects and reports**

---

### Types of IDS

#### 1️⃣ Network-based IDS (NIDS)
- Monitors entire network traffic
- Placed near gateways or firewalls
- Detects attacks like:
  - Port scanning
  - DoS attacks
  - Malware traffic

Example: Snort, Suricata

---

#### 2️⃣ Host-based IDS (HIDS)
- Installed on individual systems
- Monitors:
  - Log files
  - System calls
  - File integrity

Example: OSSEC

---

### IDS Detection Methods

- **Signature-based detection**
  - Matches known attack patterns
  - Fast but cannot detect new attacks

- **Anomaly-based detection**
  - Detects abnormal behavior
  - Can detect zero-day attacks
  - May cause false positives

---

## IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

### What is IPS?
An **IPS** actively **blocks or prevents attacks** in real time.

➡️ IPS can:
- Drop malicious packets
- Reset connections
- Block IP addresses

---

### How IPS Works
1. Traffic passes through IPS
2. IPS analyzes packets
3. If attack detected:
   - Packet is blocked
   - Alert is generated

## IDS vs IPS

| Feature | IDS | IPS |
|------|-----|-----|
| Detects attacks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Blocks traffic | ❌ | ✅ |
| Placement | Out-of-band | Inline |
| Action | Alert only | Alert + Prevention |

---

## IDS/IPS in Network Security
- Works alongside firewalls
- Protects against:
  - Brute-force attacks
  - Malware
  - Exploits
- Critical component in SOC operations

---

## Limitations
- False positives
- Encrypted traffic visibility issues
- Requires regular rule updates
