# Mitigation Techniques

Mitigation techniques are **security controls and practices** used to
**prevent, detect, and respond** to network attacks.

They reduce the **impact, spread, and damage** caused by cyber threats.

---

## 1. Firewall Security
- Filters incoming and outgoing traffic
- Blocks unauthorized access
- Enforces security policies

### Example
- Blocking unused ports
- IP-based filtering

---

## 2. IDS and IPS
- **IDS** detects suspicious activities
- **IPS** actively blocks malicious traffic
- Helps against scanning, malware, and DoS attacks

---

## 3. Network Segmentation
- Divides the network into smaller zones
- Prevents lateral movement of attackers
- Protects critical assets

---

## 4. Strong Authentication
- Use strong passwords
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Prevents unauthorized access

---

## 5. Encryption
- Encrypts data in transit
- Uses protocols like HTTPS, SSL/TLS, VPN
- Protects against sniffing and MITM attacks

---

## 6. Patch Management
- Regularly update systems and applications
- Fixes known vulnerabilities
- Reduces attack surface

---

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
- Continuous network monitoring
- Log collection and analysis
- Early detection of attacks

---

## 8. Rate Limiting
- Limits requests from a single IP
- Prevents DoS and brute-force attacks

---

## 9. Secure DNS Configuration
- Use DNSSEC
- Prevent DNS spoofing and poisoning

---

## 10. Security Awareness Training
- Educates users about phishing and attacks
- Reduces human-related risks
