# Firewall Basics

A **Firewall** is a network security device or software that
**monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic**
based on predefined security rules.

It acts as a **barrier between trusted and untrusted networks**.

---

## Why Firewalls Are Used
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Block malicious traffic
- Enforce security policies
- Protect internal networks from external attacks

---

## How a Firewall Works
1. Incoming traffic reaches the firewall
2. Firewall checks traffic against rules
3. Traffic is:
   - **Allowed** → forwarded to the network
   - **Denied** → blocked or dropped

## Types of Firewalls

### 1️⃣ Packet Filtering Firewall
- Works at **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
- Filters based on:
  - IP address
  - Port number
  - Protocol
- Fast but **no deep inspection**

Example:
Allow TCP port 80
Block all other traffic

---

### 2️⃣ Stateful Inspection Firewall
- Tracks **state of active connections**
- More secure than packet filtering
- Allows only legitimate response traffic

---

### 3️⃣ Application Layer Firewall (Proxy Firewall)
- Works at **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
- Inspects application data (HTTP, FTP, DNS)
- Slower but very secure

---

### 4️⃣ Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
- Combines:
  - Stateful inspection
  - Application awareness
  - IDS/IPS
  - Malware protection
- Used in modern enterprises

## Hardware vs Software Firewall

| Hardware Firewall | Software Firewall |
|------------------|------------------|
| Physical device | Installed on system |
| Protects entire network | Protects single system |
| Used in enterprises | Used on personal devices |

---

## Firewall in Cybersecurity & SOC
- First line of defense
- Detects suspicious traffic
- Helps in incident investigation
- Used for access control and logging

---

## Limitations of Firewalls
- Cannot stop insider threats
- Cannot detect encrypted malicious traffic alone
- Needs IDS/IPS for advanced protection
