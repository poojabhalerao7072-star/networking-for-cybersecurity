# Network Attacks

Network attacks target **network infrastructure, protocols, and services**
to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or steal data.

These attacks are commonly monitored and handled by **SOC analysts**.

---

## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
- Floods a system with excessive traffic
- Makes services unavailable to legitimate users

### Example
- SYN Flood
- ICMP Flood

### Impact
- Service downtime
- Business disruption

---

## 2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Multiple systems attack a single target
- More powerful than DoS

### Example
- Botnet-based attacks

---

## 3. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
- Attacker secretly intercepts communication
- Common on public Wi-Fi networks

### Example
- ARP Spoofing
- SSL Stripping

---

## 4. Packet Sniffing
- Capturing network packets to read sensitive data
- Happens on unsecured networks

### Example
- Password capture over HTTP

---

## 5. IP Spoofing
- Attacker fakes source IP address
- Used to bypass IP-based security

---

## 6. ARP Poisoning
- Attacker sends fake ARP responses
- Redirects traffic to attacker machine

---

## 7. DNS Attacks
- Targets DNS resolution process

### Examples
- DNS Spoofing
- DNS Cache Poisoning

---

## 8. Port Scanning
- Scanning open ports to find vulnerable services
- Common reconnaissance technique

### Tools
- Nmap
- Masscan

---

## 9. Malware-Based Network Attacks
- Malware spreads through network
- Creates backdoors or botnets

---

## Cybersecurity Impact
- Data theft
- Service disruption
- Unauthorized access
- Network compromise

---

## Detection Techniques
- IDS/IPS alerts
- SIEM correlation
- Traffic anomaly detection
- Firewall logs
