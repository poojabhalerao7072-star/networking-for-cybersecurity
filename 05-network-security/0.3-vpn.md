# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates a **secure, encrypted tunnel**
between a user and a remote network over the internet.

VPNs are widely used to **protect data, ensure privacy, and securely access internal networks**.

## How VPN Works
1. User connects to a VPN client
2. VPN client authenticates with VPN server
