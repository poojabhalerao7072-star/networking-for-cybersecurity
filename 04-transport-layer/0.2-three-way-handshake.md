# TCP Three-Way Handshake  
*(Transport Layer – Layer 4)*

The TCP Three-Way Handshake is the **process used to establish a reliable connection**
between a client and a server before data transmission begins.

---

## Why Three-Way Handshake is Needed
- To establish a **reliable connection**
- To synchronize **sequence numbers**
- To confirm both sides are **ready to communicate**
- To avoid half-open connections

---

## The Three Steps of TCP Handshake

### 1️⃣ SYN (Synchronize)
- Client sends a **SYN packet** to the server
- Indicates request to start a connection
- Includes an initial **sequence number**
Client → Server : SYN

---

### 2️⃣ SYN-ACK (Synchronize + Acknowledge)
- Server responds with **SYN-ACK**
- Acknowledges client’s SYN
- Sends its own sequence number
Server → Client : SYN + ACK

---

### 3️⃣ ACK (Acknowledge)
- Client sends **ACK** to the server
- Confirms receipt of server’s SYN
- Connection is now **established**
Client → Server : ACK

## Handshake Flow Diagram

Client               Server
| -------- SYN --------> |
| <----- SYN + ACK ----- |
| -------- ACK --------> |
Connection Established

## What Happens After Handshake?
- Data transfer begins
- TCP ensures:
  - Ordered delivery
  - Error checking
  - Flow control
  - Congestion control

---

## Cybersecurity Perspective

### Common Attacks
- **SYN Flood Attack**
  - Attacker sends many SYN packets
  - Server resources get exhausted
  - Leads to Denial of Service (DoS)

### Detection & Prevention
- SYN cookies
- Firewall rate limiting
- IDS/IPS monitoring abnormal SYN packets

---

## Why Three-Way Handshake is Important
- Ensures secure and reliable communication
- Helps identify legitimate clients
- Foundation for many security controls
- Critical for firewall and SOC analysis
