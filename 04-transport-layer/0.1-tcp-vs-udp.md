# TCP vs UDP (Transport Layer)

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** protocols.
They define **how data is transmitted between applications** over a network.

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is a **connection-oriented** and **reliable** protocol.

### Main Characteristics
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable data delivery
- Error detection and correction
- Flow control and congestion control
- Data is delivered **in order**

### How TCP Works
1. Connection is established (Three-Way Handshake)
2. Data is transmitted in segments
3. Acknowledgements are sent
4. Connection is terminated properly

### Common TCP Applications
- HTTP / HTTPS (80 / 443)
- FTP (21)
- SMTP (25)
- SSH (22)

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

UDP is a **connectionless** and **unreliable** protocol.

### Main Characteristics
- Connectionless
- No delivery guarantee
- No error recovery
- Faster than TCP
- No congestion control

### How UDP Works
- Data is sent without checking if the receiver is ready
- No acknowledgement is received
- Packets may be lost or arrive out of order

### Common UDP Applications
- DNS (53)
- DHCP (67/68)
- VoIP
- Video Streaming
- Online Gaming

## TCP vs UDP Comparison Table

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
|------|-----|-----|
| Connection Type | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Reliability | Reliable | Unreliable |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Error Control | Yes | No |
| Flow Control | Yes | No |
| Ordering | Guaranteed | Not guaranteed |
| Header Size | 20 bytes | 8 bytes |

## Cybersecurity Perspective

### TCP Security Concerns
- SYN Flood attacks
- Session hijacking
- TCP Reset attacks

### UDP Security Concerns
- UDP Flood attacks
- Amplification attacks (DNS, NTP)
- Harder to monitor due to lack of sessions

---

## Why Both Are Important
- TCP ensures **accuracy and reliability**
- UDP ensures **speed and low latency**
- Security tools and firewalls must understand **both protocols**
