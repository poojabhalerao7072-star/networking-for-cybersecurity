# Common Transport Layer Attacks  

Transport Layer attacks target **TCP and UDP protocols**, exploiting how connections, ports,
and sessions are handled. These attacks often result in **Denial of Service (DoS)** or **service disruption**.

---

## Why Transport Layer is Targeted
- Uses **ports** (easy to scan)
- Manages **sessions and connections**
- Limited validation at protocol level
- Directly affects application availability

---

## Common Transport Layer Attacks

### 1️⃣ SYN Flood Attack (TCP)

**What it is**
- Attacker sends a large number of **SYN packets**
- Does not complete the TCP handshake

**Impact**
- Server resources exhausted
- Legitimate users denied access

**Defense**
- SYN cookies
- Firewall rate limiting
- IDS/IPS alerts

---

### 2️⃣ UDP Flood Attack (UDP)

**What it is**
- Large volume of UDP packets sent to random ports

**Impact**
- Bandwidth exhaustion
- High CPU usage
- Service slowdown

**Defense**
- Rate limiting
- Blocking unused UDP ports
- Traffic monitoring

---

### 3️⃣ Port Scanning

**What it is**
- Attacker scans open TCP/UDP ports
- Used for reconnaissance

**Impact**
- Reveals running services
- Helps plan further attacks

**Defense**
- Firewall rules
- IDS detection
- Close unused ports

---

### 4️⃣ TCP Session Hijacking

**What it is**
- Attacker takes over an active TCP session
- Exploits predictable sequence numbers

**Impact**
- Data theft
- Unauthorized access

**Defense**
- Encrypted protocols (TLS)
- Secure sequence number generation

---

### 5️⃣ TCP Reset (RST) Attack

**What it is**
- Fake TCP RST packets terminate connections

**Impact**
- Session interruption
- Service instability

**Defense**
- Firewall filtering
- Encrypted communication

---

## Cybersecurity Importance
- SOC teams monitor Layer 4 traffic
- Firewalls apply port-based filtering
- IDS/IPS detect abnormal packet behavior
- Transport attacks often precede application attacks

---

## Best Practices
- Close unused ports
- Apply rate limiting
- Monitor traffic continuously
- Use IDS/IPS and firewalls
- Encrypt sensitive connections
