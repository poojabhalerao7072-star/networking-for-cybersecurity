## TCP/IP Model Layers and Functions

### 4️⃣ Application Layer
- Provides network services to applications
- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SSH


### 3️⃣ Transport Layer
- Ensures reliable end-to-end communication
- Protocols: TCP, UDP


### 2️⃣ Internet Layer
- Handles logical addressing and routing
- Protocols: IP, ICMP, ARP


### 1️⃣ Network Access Layer
- Handles physical transmission and MAC addressing
- Technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi
- 

## OSI vs TCP/IP Comparison

| OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |
|----------|--------------|
| 7 layers | 4 layers |
| Theoretical | Practical |
| Used for learning | Used in real networks |

## Importance in Cybersecurity
- Used in firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Helps understand network-based attacks
- Essential for ethical hacking
