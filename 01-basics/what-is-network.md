# What is a Network?

A network is a group of two or more devices connected together so they can communicate
and share data, resources, and services with each other.

Devices in a network can include:
- Computers and laptops
- Mobile phones
- Servers
- Printers
- Routers and switches
  

## Why Networks Are Needed
Networks make communication fast and efficient. They allow:
- Sharing files and data
- Accessing the internet
- Using shared resources like printers
- Centralized management and control

Without networks, each device would work independently and communication would be slow
and limited.


## How a Network Works (Basic Idea)
1. A device sends data in the form of packets
2. Network devices (like switches and routers) forward the packets
3. The data reaches the destination device
4. The destination device responds if required
