# Network Topology

Network topology refers to the **physical or logical layout** of devices in a network.

---

## Why Network Topology is Important
- Defines how devices communicate
- Impacts performance and scalability
- Helps in network troubleshooting
- Critical for cybersecurity planning

---

## Types of Network Topology

### 1️⃣ Bus Topology
- All devices share a single cable
- Simple but not secure

Pros:
- Easy to set up  
Cons:
- Single point of failure

---

### 2️⃣ Star Topology
- All devices connect to a central switch
- Most commonly used topology

Pros:
- Easy to manage
- Better security  
Cons:
- Switch failure affects network

---

### 3️⃣ Ring Topology
- Devices form a circular loop
- Data flows in one direction

Pros:
- Equal access  
Cons:
- Failure breaks the loop

---

### 4️⃣ Mesh Topology
- Devices connect to multiple devices
- High redundancy

Pros:
- Very reliable  
Cons:
- Expensive and complex

---

### 5️⃣ Tree Topology
- Hierarchical structure
- Combination of star and bus

Used in:
- Enterprise networks

---

### 6️⃣ Hybrid Topology
- Combination of multiple topologies
- Flexible and scalable

---

## Physical vs Logical Topology
| Physical | Logical |
|--------|--------|
| Actual cabling | Data flow |
| Hardware layout | Communication path |

---

## Cybersecurity Importance
- Poor topology increases attack surface
- Star and VLAN-based designs improve security
- Mesh improves availability (DDoS resilience)
